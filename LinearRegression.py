# By using a new dataSet, you may consider modify:
# 1. path, dataset. Locate the dateset and read it.
# 2. x_train, y_train. Change the training examples. You may consider rescale with different Rescaling method by change FeatureScaling.meanNormal(x_train).
# 3. w, b, a, epoch. The initial weight, bias, learning rate, amount of iteration. Since feature rescaled, may choose a slightly large learning rate
